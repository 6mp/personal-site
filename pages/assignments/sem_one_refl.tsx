                    I came into this semester expecting to meet many new people,
                    learn a ton of new stuff, and have fun while doing these
                    things. Reality exceeded my expectations in more ways than
                    one. Through just this first semester I have been able to
                    meet so many new great people and form lasting friendships.
                    I have also been blown away by the amount of knowledge and
                    skills I have gained through my classes. The professors and
                    staff at the college have been incredibly helpful and
                    supportive, and I have truly enjoyed the college experience
                    so far. Though it was not all sunshine and rainbows, I
                    struggled with my academics initially at the start of the
                    year due to poor time management. Luckily I was able to turn
                    things around with the help of my friends and professors. I
                    learned to prioritize my time and focus on my studies, which
                    allowed me to perform better in my classes. I also took
                    advantage of the academic resources available to me, such as
                    tutoring and study groups, which helped me to better
                    understand the material. Overall, despite the challenges I
                    faced, I am proud of the progress I have made during this
                    first semester and am looking forward to continuing my
                    academic journey in the future.

                    Media Scholars has been an incredibly rewarding experience
                    for me from day one. I enjoyed our service trip a lot as it
                    was a great bonding exercise with the class and allowed us
                    to give back to the community. In addition to the service
                    trip, I have had the opportunity to attend guest lectures
                    and participate in invaluable group projects and
                    discussions. Through these activities, I have gained
                    valuable insights into media and have had the chance to
                    develop my own skills and knowledge. I have also had the
                    chance to connect with other Media Scholars students and
                    form lasting friendships.

                    One of the most meaningful aspects of Media Scholars for me
                    has been the sense of community and support. The faculty and
                    staff have been incredibly helpful and supportive, and the
                    other students have been a great source of encouragement and
                    motivation. We have all been able to learn from each other
                    and push each other to succeed.

                    In addition to the academic opportunities that Media
                    Scholars has provided, I have also had the chance to
                    participate in extracurricular activities and events. One of
                    the most memorable experiences for me has been the field
                    trips we have taken as part of Media Scholars. For example,
                    we visited the African American history museum, which was a
                    truly eye-opening experience. I learned so much about the
                    history and culture of African Americans, and was able to
                    see artifacts and exhibits that brought the history to life.
                    It was a powerful reminder of the struggles and achievements
                    of African Americans, and helped me to better understand
                    their experiences.

                    Another field trip that stood out for me was our visit to
                    the esports room in Knight Hall. I am interested in esports
                    so this was a really fun trip for me. I was able to see the
                    high-tech equipment and setup that the esports team uses. It
                    was a fun and exciting experience, and I learned a lot about
                    the esports industry and how it ties into the school of
                    journalism here.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    I am grateful for the opportunities and experiences I have
                    had through Media Scholars, and am excited to see what other
                    field trips and activities we have in store for the future.
